        <t class="aboutText">Hi, I'm Benjamin Gerdjunis and this is my website. <br/>
        This is a fairly simple site to show that I can make one as well as display a few other projects.<br/>
        Anyways heres my <a href="https://github.com/gerdjunisben">github</a>, sorry, a lot of it is mostly private so that my previous professors don't have to rewrite everything to avoid cheating.<br/>
        Here's my <a href = "mailto: benjamingerdjunis@gmail.com">email</a> if you have to reach me.<br/>
        Have a lovely rest of your day or night :)</t>
